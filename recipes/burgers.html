        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Juicy, tangy, and thick burgers topped with fresh avocado, crispy bacon, and a zesty barbecue sauce. Perfect to serve up during those summer months.</p>
        <h4> Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef, 80% lean</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cups bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>8 Slices bacon</li>
            <li>1-2 tomatoes (yield 6-8 slices)</li>
            <li>A head of lettuce or bag of spinach</li>
            <li>1 avocado (2 if you like extra avocado like me)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons barbecue sauce (more if you like it extra saucy)</li>
            <li>4 burger buns (my recommended bun is a brioche onion bun, but any will do)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put ground beef into a bowl then crack the egg into it</li>
            <li>Add breadcrumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, and paprika to the bowl</li>
            <li>Mix beef and egg mixture with hands, forming into 4 equal sized patties (about 6-ounces each);refrigerate</li>
            <li>Prepare toppings: cook bacon til crispy, wash lettuce/spinach, slice tomato and avocado; Set aside</li>
            <li>Preheat 3/4 grtill to medium heat and season patties with salt and pepper. Place burgers over direct heat and grill 2-3 minutes on the first side. Flip and baste with barbecue sauce and grill 2-3 more minutes</li>
            <li>Flip again and baste with barbecue sauce and move patties to the cool side of the grill to finish cooking (internal temperature should reach 160&deg;F)</li>
            <li>Build your burgers from bottom to top; bottom bun, lettuce/spinach, tomato, burger, bacon, avocado, and top bun. Additional barbecue sauce can be placed directly on the burger, between it and the bacon for more flavor</li>
            <li>Enjoy your juicy and tangy Avocado Barbecue Bacon Burgers</li>
        </ol>
