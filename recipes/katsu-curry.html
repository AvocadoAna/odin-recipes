        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Katsu curry with a chicken cutlet on top. Store-bought blocks of Japanese curry roux are most commonly used in Japanese households, and as such we will be using the same to bring that same taste.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless and skinless chicken breasts (about 5 ounces each)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup Panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>oil to fry with</li>
            <li>3 1/3 cups of water</li>
            <li>1/2 packet of House Vermont Curry (you can use medium-hot, mild, hot, or even a different curry brand instead of House Food)</li>
            <li>1 medium Onion sliced into 1/3" pieces</li>
            <li>2 Potatoes sliced into 1/2" cubes</li>
            <li>1 Carrot sliced into 1/4" pieces (if carrot is fat you may want to cut lengthwise then slice)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon oil to a pot and heat over medium heat</li>
            <li> While the pot is heating up, season the chicken with salt and pepper. Make sure it's all over</li>
            <li>Place flour, egg, and breadcrumbs in a shallow plate or bowl individually and line them up.</li>
            <li> One fillet at a time, coat with flour, shake off excess, place into egg and coat all over, and then trasnfer to breadcrumbs, ensuring the fillet is covered all over. Repeat for the rest of the fillets</li>
            <li>Add Onion and cook for a few minutes or until the onion becomes translucent and the edges are slightly burnt</li>
            <li>While cooking the onions, heat a deep frying pan until around 170-180&deg;C. A good way to check without a thermometer is to drop a bit of breadcrumbs into it and make sure they spread with tiny bubbles around them.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes and carrots to the pit and stir for a couple of minutes or until the surface of the vegetables starts getting cooked</li>
            <li>Add water to the vegetable pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the ream to medium low and simmer for about 7 minutes or until veggies are cooked through (skewer going through veggies easily)</li>
            <li>After adding the water and reducing heat to a simmer, in your frying pan gently place a fillet in. Depending on size you can do one or more at a time. Beware of overcrowding the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry for about 3 minutes then flip the fillet using tongs and cook for another 3 minutes. Both sides should be browned. Transfer to a tray with liners and let rest for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Break curry roux into small blocks along the the lines and add to veggie pot. Stir gently to blend it in, then reduce heat and put a lid on for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Check consistency of the sauce, all the curry roux should be blended in. If it's too thick, add a bit of extra water, and if too thin then cook for a few minutes with the lid off.</li>
            <li>Now that the chicken has rested, cut each one into 1" wide strips</li>
            <li>Ensure heat on both burners is turned off</li>
            <li>Place a cup of cooked rice on one side of the plate, and next to it place your cutlet strips. Ensure they are slightly leaning on the rice.</li>
            <li>Pour curry next to chicken cutlet and serve immediately</li>
        </ol>
