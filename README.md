In this repository my current project was to make a page with a few recipes. I utilized terminal commands to make directories and create .html files, add and commit repository changes, and rename saved images for easier access in the .html files.

I used my knowledge to write out each html boilerplate to ensure I know the layout properly. I also utilized what The Odin Project has taught me about embedding images, making headers, creating lists (both unorganized and organized), anchoring links, and how to word a commit message.

After finishing the Box Model portion of TOP I used my knowledge to style my recipe pages further. I added a border, created div classes to help seperate the background color and help the recipes stand out more. I added a shadow to the boxes, styled my lists, and used margins/padding to help clean up the clunkiness the pages had prior.
